## A Look Into The Past Website And Blog
This project is based on antique dolls, its designers, and value nowadays. There are so many different dolls, each representing somethin in particular. Most of the dolls are organized in categories. These being: brides, babies, for charity, and others. The blog area as its name shows, is a space in which we talk about the history of the dolls, its creators, value, and context in which they were made.
